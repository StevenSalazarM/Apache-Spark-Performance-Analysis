1) Check negative time, atm only get_times.py from OverallTimeCache and LoadTimeNoCache got partially fixed. This must be included in all get_times.py files and for every date2-date1
2) Redo test m5_2xlarge 2 worker 4 cores, the load time cache was a lot higher of what expected, the web UI shows that there were some problems with worker 0, it wasnt able to use all his memory so it was requiring more time. Atm only one test was correct so we are using that value
3) Add more tests for m5_2xlarge
4) same as 2) but for 2_worker_8_cores with load_time_no_cache, atm just removed those two values and replaced with 2 correct values (check web UI)
5) try increasing the number of executors, you should obtain better values. For example with 2 VM-4 executors cache and no cache
6) from test_m5_2xlarge plot_overall.py it is possible to see that the difference of time between cache and no cache decrease by increasing the number of cores and worker, maybe try with more cores and more workers. I bet it comes better idk why, i didnt expect this kind of behaviour
